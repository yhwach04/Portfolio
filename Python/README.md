### DATA ANALYTICS WITH PYTHON
Welcome to the world of data analytics with Python! In this file, you will find a collection of projects and resources that showcase the power and versatility of Python in data analysis.

Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used in data analysis. It has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to perform complex data analysis tasks, such as data mining, data visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning.

In this file, you will find examples of Python code that demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis using Python. You'll find a diverse set of projects that covers a wide range of data analysis techniques, such as data cleaning, data exploration, data visualization, and statistical modeling. These projects showcase my ability to extract insights from data and present them in a clear and visually appealing way.

I have also included resources to help you improve your data analysis skills with Python. These resources include tutorials, exercises, and examples that will help you learn the basics of Python and how to use it for data analysis. Whether you are new to data analysis or a seasoned data analyst looking to improve your skills, you will find something of value in this folder.

I hope you find this repository to be informative and engaging. I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications and experience further. Thank you for visiting my repository and happy data analyzing with Python!

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list all my projects that is related to data analytics and my research studies.

### Effects of anisotropic mass into the Brownian motion of charged particle in oblique electric and magnetic fields
**Code:** [`Brownian_motion_of_charged_particle_in_oblique_EM_fields.ipynb`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/Brownian_motion_of_charged_particle_in_oblique_EM_fields.ipynb)

**Objectives:** To investigate the effects of anisotropic mass in a charged Brownian particle under electric and magnetic fields.

**Conclusions:** The study shows that the electric field causes the Brownian particle to bends the elliptacl trajectory caused by the magnetic fields.

**Skills:** mathematical modelling, theoretical physics

### Data Science Job Salaries Analysis

**Code:** [`Data Science Job Analysis`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/datascience-eda.ipynb)

**Description:** The data set contains records of data science job salaries, job titles, job experience, and etc. Here, the project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, data visualization and EDA (exploratory data analysis). Visualizing the distribution of salaries, exploring the relationship between job titles, experience levels, and salaries, and identifying trends and patterns within the data.
 
### Covid-19 Data Exploration

**Code:** [`Covid19_EDA`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/covid19-eda.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis). Analyzing the spread of Covid-19 cases and deaths over time, examining the effectiveness of vaccines, and comparing the impact of Covid-19 across different countries.

 ### CMU Weather Data Analysis

 **Code:** [`CMU Weather Data Analysis`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/Weather_Data_Analysis.ipynb)

 **Decription:** The dataset contains records of the CMU weather station. This project was done with the collaboration of Central Mindanao University - Physics Department, in which I have analyzed the weather data that was gathered from a local weather station of CMU. Visualizing and analyizing the temperature, humidity, precipitation, and weather conditions plots.
