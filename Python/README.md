# Python Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list all my projects that is related to data analytics (Python) and my research studies.

## [`Brownian_motion_of_charged_particle_in_oblique_EM_fields`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/Brownian_motion_of_charged_particle_in_oblique_EM_fields.ipynb)

**Objectives:** To investigate the effects of anisotropic mass in a charged Brownian particle under electric and magnetic fields.

**Conclusions:** The study shows that the electric field causes the Brownian particle to bends the elliptacl trajectory caused by the magnetic fields.

**Skills:** mathematical modelling, theoretical physics, numpy, matplotlib

## [`Data Science Job Analysis`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/datascience-eda.ipynb)

**Description:** The data set contains records of data science job salaries, job titles, job experience, and etc. Here, the project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, data visualization and EDA (exploratory data analysis). Visualizing the distribution of salaries, exploring the relationship between job titles, experience levels, and salaries, and identifying trends and patterns within the data.

**Skills:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## [`CMU Weather Data Analysis`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/Weather_Data_Analysis.ipynb)

 **Decription:** The dataset contains records of the CMU weather station. This project was done with the collaboration of Central Mindanao University - Physics Department, in which I have analyzed the weather data that was gathered from a local weather station of CMU. Visualizing and analyizing the temperature, humidity, precipitation, and weather conditions plots.

 **Skills:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

 ## [`Supermarket Sales Analysis`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/Python/supermarket-sales.ipynb)

 **Description:** This project involved a comprehensive analysis of supermarket sales data to generate insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product preferences. The dataset included detailed transaction records with attributes such as product categories, sales amounts, payment methods, and customer demographics. The primary objectives were to identify sales trends, determine the most popular products, and uncover patterns in customer purchasing behavior.

 **Skills:** Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization

 ## [`Spotify Data Analysis`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/Python/SPOTIFY_EDA.ipynb) 

 **Description:** This project involved an in-depth analysis of Spotify's music data to uncover insights about music trends, listener preferences, and song characteristics. The dataset included information on various tracks, artists, genres, and listener behavior. The primary objectives were to analyze the characteristics of popular songs, understand listener preferences across different genres, and identify trends in music consumption

 **Skills:** Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization
