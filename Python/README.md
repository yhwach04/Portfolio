# Python Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list all my projects that is related to data analytics (Python) and my research studies.

## [`Brownian_motion_of_charged_particle_in_oblique_EM_fields.ipynb`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/Brownian_motion_of_charged_particle_in_oblique_EM_fields.ipynb)

**Objectives:** To investigate the effects of anisotropic mass in a charged Brownian particle under electric and magnetic fields.

**Conclusions:** The study shows that the electric field causes the Brownian particle to bends the elliptacl trajectory caused by the magnetic fields.

**Skills:** mathematical modelling, theoretical physics, numpy, matplotlib

## [`Data Science Job Analysis`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/datascience-eda.ipynb)

**Description:** The data set contains records of data science job salaries, job titles, job experience, and etc. Here, the project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, data visualization and EDA (exploratory data analysis). Visualizing the distribution of salaries, exploring the relationship between job titles, experience levels, and salaries, and identifying trends and patterns within the data.

**Skills:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## [`CMU Weather Data Analysis`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/Weather_Data_Analysis.ipynb)

 **Decription:** The dataset contains records of the CMU weather station. This project was done with the collaboration of Central Mindanao University - Physics Department, in which I have analyzed the weather data that was gathered from a local weather station of CMU. Visualizing and analyizing the temperature, humidity, precipitation, and weather conditions plots.

 **Skills:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

 ## [`Spotify EDA`]()
