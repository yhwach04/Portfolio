# John Paul Cañete - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi! I'm John Paul Cañete, I have a background in theoretical physics and currently I am practicing Data Analytics. I have developed in the physical sciences and a passion for data to uncover meaningful insites. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list all my projects that is related to data analytics and my research studies.

### Effects of anisotropic mass into the Brownian motion of charged particle in oblique electric and magnetic fields
**Code:** [`Brownian_motion_of_charged_particle_in_oblique_EM_fields.ipynb`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/Brownian_motion_of_charged_particle_in_oblique_EM_fields.ipynb)

**Objectives:** To investigate the effects of anisotropic mass in a charged Brownian particle under electric and magnetic fields.

**Conclusions:** The study shows that the electric field causes the Brownian particle to bends the elliptacl trajectory caused by the magnetic fields.

**Skills:** mathematical modelling, theoretical physics

### Data Science Job Salaries Analysis

**Code:** [`Data Science Job Analysis`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/datascience-eda.ipynb)

**Description:** The data set contains records of data science job salaries, job titles, job experience, and etc. Here, the project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, data visualization and EDA (exploratory data analysis). 
 
### Covid-19 Data Exploration

**Code:** [`Covid19_EDA`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/covid19-eda.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

 ### Spotify Tracks Analysis

**Code:** [`Spotify Data Analysis`](https://github.com/yhwach04/Portfolio/blob/main/SPOTIFY_EDA.ipynb)

 **Description:** The dataset contains records of Spotify tracks. The dataset includes the tracks artists, genres, and etc. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning, analyzing tracks data and hypothesis testing.
