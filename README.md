Hi! I'm John Paul G. Ca√±ete, I have a background in theoretical physics and currently I am practicing Data Analytics. I have developed in the physical sciences and a passion for data to uncover meaningful insites. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science. 
During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends.
