# John Paul Cañete - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi! I'm John Paul Cañete, I have a background in theoretical physics and currently I am practicing Data Analytics. I have developed in the physical sciences and a passion for data to uncover meaningful insites. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
